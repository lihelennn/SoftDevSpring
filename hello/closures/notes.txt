Closures
1. A function is declared inside another function
2. Inner function accesses a variable from the outer function (outside the scope of the inner function)
3. The external function binds a value to the variable and finishes (or closes) before the inner function can be completed

def repeat(s):
    def times(x):
    	return s + x
    return times

This is an example of a nested function, but NOT a closure because s, the external variable to times, is not bounded by any value.
